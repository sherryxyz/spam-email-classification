## Spam Email Classification 

### Introduction
Spam emails have become a significant problem in today's digital world. This project aims to build a robust and accurate spam email classifier using various machine-learning models. The classifier is trained and evaluated on the Spambase Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Two robust models were built based on the objectives below:
- 1. Best predictive accuracy
- 2. Best cost-sensitive 

### Dataset Description
The Spambase Dataset contains pre-processed email features extracted from 4,601 emails, with each email classified as spam (1) or non-spam (0). The dataset consists of 57 attributes, including word frequency counts, character frequency counts, and other relevant features.

### Models Explored
The following machine-learning models were explored for spam email classification:

Logistic Regression
K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Neural Network
Ensemble Model - Random Forest
